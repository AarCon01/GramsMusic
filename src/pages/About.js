        <h2>Roadmap</h2>
        <p>I will be prioritizing certain elements of the music to make sure I can get them out sooner to everyone. Because I'm transcribing from written records without sheet music, it's harder to get everything in first go around.</p>
        <p>This is an expected Release Roadmap that I'll do my best at following.</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Version 0.1.0 Initial Release</dt>
          <li>Rhythms</li>
          <li>Ukulele Chords (Notated)</li>
          <li>Lyrics</li>
        </dl>
        <dl>
          <dt>Version 0.2.0</dt>
          <li>Melodies</li>
          <li>Harmonies</li>
        </dl>
        <dl>
          <dt>Version 0.3.0</dt>
          <li>Accompaniment</li>
        </dl>
        <dl>
          <dt>Version 0.4.0</dt>
          <li>Auto Scrolling Scores</li>

        <dl>
          <dt>Version 0.5.0</dt>
